Setting Up E-commerce Project
-----------------------------

What I did today for this section
1. Created a new react-app called crown-ecommerce
2. Had all code in homepage.component but then seperated into different components.
3. Have a page folder which has static components
4. Components folder has all my components
5. Each component has a .sass style which is just css but cooler I guess

& in scass means it wants to append additional selector to class above it.
scass makes it easy to nest css within blocks


Routing in React
-------------------
We are Using React Router DOM 

running into conflicts -
 1. add resolutions : {

 BrowseRouter gives the functionality of routing. 
 Look at the index.js

 In your class which you want routing add the following import 
 import {Route} from 'react-router-dom'


 <Route exact {true or false} path = "/" component = {} />

exact - must be at the same path in url in order to render the specified component

 In react-router-dom, any component that gets rendered in the route,
 gets passed 3 arguments. If you do a console.log(props) you will see 
 history,location,match

 params is an object passed into url
 we can access using this below
 {props.match.params.topicId}

 Link component in react-router-dom:
 lets us dynamically pass in in links like a <a> link 
 <Link to="/"> Home Page </Link>

 using history prop to go to a page
<button onClick = { () => props.history.push('/page')}> To Pages </button>

location prop tells us where we are current ly

Look into prop tunneling aka prop drilling

withRouter - a higher order component. 
Takes a component as argument and returns modified component,
